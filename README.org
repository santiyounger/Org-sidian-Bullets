** Intro
   
   The purpose of this code is to use css in obsidian.css to make headers look like org-mode bullet points, this is inspired by [[https://github.com/sabof/org-bullets][org-bullets for org-mode]].

   This is what it looks like in Obsidian after adding the simple version code: [[file:org-sidian.css]]

   Theme Used Reverie: Santi Younger (Available in the community themes) 
 You can also find [[https://github.com/santiyounger/Reverie-Obsidian-Theme][Reverie on Github]].
end_quote

   This css code is meant to replace the hashtag symbol # used for headers and change it to cool UTF-8 symbols.
 
 #+begin_quote
 Side Note: Everything I’ll talk about is for edit mode
 #+end_quote

 This is what it's doing
    
 #+BEGIN_SRC css
 H1 - instead of # display ◉
 H2 - instead of ## display ✸
 H3 - instead of ### display ✿
 H4 - instead of #### display ◉
 H5 - instead of ##### display ✸
 H6 - instead of ###### display ✿
 #+END_SRC 

 I come from using spacemacs and I love org-mode. I moved most of my workflow to obsidian, but there’s one thing I really miss, which is org-bullet points (which adds cools symbols to headings).

** Things To Consider
There's a nice indentation with every heading (achieved through left margins in the code).

This allows for easier visualization of heading level.
 
It looks like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC html
 ◉
  ○
   ✸
     ◉
      ○
       ✸
#+END_SRC 

** Installation/Set-Up
   
   Set-up is very easy.

   1. Open one of the links bellow to select the code.
   
  2. Copy the code, and paste it at the end of your *obsidian.css file.*

begin_quote     
   Keep in mind that some obsidian theme's might not be compatible.
end_quote     
   
   If you want to test it, do it with my [[https://github.com/santiyounger/Reverie-Obsidian-Theme][Obsidian Theme Reverie]], which should work without a problem.
  
** Code 
   open one of the following links to select the code to copy paste in obsidian.css
***  Simple Version
    [[file:org-sidian.css]]
    This version adapts to your theme's heading colors.
 
***  Colored Bullet Points Version
    [[file:colored-org-sidian.css]]
    This version has a yellow and red set-up. You can easily change it to your taste with hex codes.

** Considerations
***  Same heading sizes
  This looks a lot better when all headings are the same size.
  By default my theme [[https://github.com/santiyounger/Reverie-Obsidian-Theme][Reverie]] doesn't have same heading size, but it's fairly simple to change the code to make this possible.

  Learn how to create same heading sizes from the obsidian forum:
[[https://forum.obsidian.md/t/make-all-headings-same-size-as-lvl4-heading/5962][Make all headings same size- Obsidian Forum]] 

** Special Thanks
  Special Thanks [[https://forum.obsidian.md/t/hide-or-truncate-urls-in-editor-using-css/359/14][death.au]]. Thanks to [[https://forum.obsidian.md/t/hide-or-truncate-urls-in-editor-using-css/359/14][his code]] helped me figure out how to achieve this whole thing.
  
** Additional Possible Features

 Org-mode also allows for a shortcut such as alt+→ to move headings quickly from h1 to h2 and so on. and alt+ ← to move from h2 to h1

 This is something I’d like to turn into a request or if possible even develop as a plug in (perhaps as I get more advanced with JavaScript, it might be possible).
