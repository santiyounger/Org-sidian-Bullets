** Intro

   The purpose of this code is to use css in obsidian.css to make headers look like org-mode bullet points, this is inspired by [[https://github.com/sabof/org-bullets][org-bullets for org-mode]].

   This is what it looks like in Obsidian after adding the simple version code: [[file:org-sidian.css]]

#+BEGIN_COMMENT
#  [Take a new screen short for heading Reverie](#TODO:10)
I need to **fix the "Heading 1" Since there's a space after the "1"**
#+END_COMMENT

     [[file:img/reverie-bullets.png]]

#+begin_quote
     Theme Used Reverie: Santi Younger (Available in the community themes)
   You can also find [[https://github.com/santiyounger/Reverie-Obsidian-Theme][Reverie on Github]].
#+end_quote

     This css code is meant to replace the hashtag symbol # used for headers and change it to cool UTF-8 symbols.

  #+begin_quote
   Side Note: Everything I’ll talk about is for edit mode
  #+end_quote

   This is what it's doing:

  #+BEGIN_SRC css
   H1 - instead of # display ◉
   H2 - instead of ## display ✸
   H3 - instead of ### display ✿
   H4 - instead of #### display ◉
   H5 - instead of ##### display ✸
   H6 - instead of ###### display ✿
 #+END_SRC

 I come from using spacemacs and I love org-mode. I moved most of my workflow to obsidian, but there’s one thing I really miss, which is org-bullet points (which adds cools symbols to headings).

** This Is What The Original Looks Like In Emacs /Spacemacs

** Built-in Indentation
There's a nice indentation with every heading (achieved through left margins in the code).

This allows for easier visualization of heading level.

It looks like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC html
 ◉
  ○
   ✸
     ◉
      ○
       ✸
#+END_SRC

** Installation/Set-Up

   If you know how to use obsidian snippets, you know what to do. 
   

   If not, let me walk you thought it.

   ---
   
   Download this code by pressing the green button called Code at the top right corner.

    Click on Download Zip
    Once it’s in your downloads folder unzip it.
   
Choose either 

org-sidian-color.css 

or

org-sidian.css

Check the section the-different-versions-of-this-code
to know which one you prefer

go to your .obsidian folder and create a folder called snippets.

paste the org-sidian.css file in there.

 #+begin_quote
    Keep in mind that some obsidian theme's might not be compatible.
 #+end_quote

    If you want to test it, do it with my [[https://github.com/santiyounger/Reverie-Obsidian-Theme][Obsidian Theme Reverie]], which should work without a problem.

This also works great with my other Theme, [[https://github.com/santiyounger/Wasp-Obsidian-Theme][Wasp-Obsidian-Theme]] 
Both can be found in Obsidian's community themes.

** The different versions of this code

   There are 2 different styles you can go for, one is `org-sidian.css` and the other is simply called `org-sidian.css`
   
What's the difference? you may ask, I'm glad you ask, let me tell you.


***  Simple Version
**** org-sidian.css
     [[file:org-sidian.css]]
  This one is simple without any added colors, it will adapt to your themes heading colors better.

***  Colored Bullet Points Version
**** org-sidian-color.css 
     [[file:org-sidian-color.css]]
    
     This version has a yellow and red set-up. You can easily change it to your taste with hex codes.
    This colored version is made to work great with my [[https://github.com/santiyounger/Wasp-Obsidian-Theme][Wasp-Obsidian-Theme]]  which can be found in Obsidian's community themes.

** Considerations
***  Same heading sizes
  This looks a lot better when all headings are the same size.
  By default my theme [[https://github.com/santiyounger/Reverie-Obsidian-Theme][Reverie]] doesn't have same heading size, but it's fairly simple to change the code to make this possible.

  Learn how to create same heading sizes from the obsidian forum:
[[https://forum.obsidian.md/t/make-all-headings-same-size-as-lvl4-heading/5962][Make all headings same size- Obsidian Forum]]

** Special Thanks
  Special thanks to [[https://forum.obsidian.md/t/hide-or-truncate-urls-in-editor-using-css/359/14][death.au]]. Thanks to [[https://forum.obsidian.md/t/hide-or-truncate-urls-in-editor-using-css/359/14][his code]] I was able to achieve this whole thing.

** Additional Possible Features
 Org-mode also allows for a shortcut such as alt+→ to move headings quickly from h1 to h2 and so on. and alt+ ← to move from h2 to h1

 This is something I’d like to turn into a request or if possible even develop as a plug in (perhaps as I get more advanced with JavaScript, it might be possible).

** Versions
*** Version 2.0 
 Fixed bug that made some headings display symbols more than once in edit mode.

Now things work great in edit and preview mode.

*** Version 1.1 
 Changed "heading 2" symbols from  "○" to "⭗" in preview mode.

*** Version 1.0
 Added code for preview mode.

*** Version 0.1
 Initial code, still to be tested with different themes and use cases.
