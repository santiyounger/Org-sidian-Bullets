** Intro
https://github.com/santiyounger/Org-sidian-Bullets/blob/6a808a0be7a242a5da0e6bee753e723f6cc77acb/org-sidian.css#L1-L41
     The purpose of this code is to use css in obsidian.css to make headers look like org-mode bullet points as seen here: [[https://github.com/sabof/org-bullets][GitHub - sabof/org-bullets: utf-8 bullets for org-mode]] 

 This is what it looks like

     Theme Used Reverie: Santi Younger (available in the community themes) 
You can also find [[https://github.com/santiyounger/Reverie-Obsidian-Theme][Reverie on Github]].

 this css code to replace the hashtag symbol # used for headers and change it for UTF-8 symbols.

 #+begin_quote
 Side Note: Everything I’ll talk about is for edit mode
 #+end_quote
    
 #+BEGIN_SRC css
 H1 instead of # display ◉
 H2 instead of ## display ✸
 H3 instead of ### display ✿
 H4 instead of #### display ◉
 H5 instead of ##### display ✸
 H6 instead of ###### display ✿
 and so on…
 #+END_SRC 

 I come from using spacemacs and I love org-mode. I moved most of my workflow to obsidian, but there’s one thing I really miss, which is org-bullet points (this adds cools symbols to headings)

** This Is What It Looks Like In Emacs /Spacemacs
   
   This screenshot is my from my Spacemacs set-up.

  Here’s the code to put in your obsidian.css file

  I haven’t yet tested in various themes, but it works okay so far!

** Things To Consider

 There are spaces that allow this kind of indentation (achieved through left margins in the code).
 
#+BEGIN_SRC html
 ◉
  ○
   ✸
     ◉
      ○
       ✸
#+END_SRC 

** Installation/Set-Up

   Set-up is very easy, open one of the links bellow to the code.
   copy and paste it at the end of your obsidian.css file.*

   Keep in mind that some obsidian theme's might not be compatible.

   If you want to test it, do it with my [[https://github.com/santiyounger/Reverie-Obsidian-Theme][Obsidian Theme Reverie]].

** Considerations
 This looks a lot better when all headings are the same size

** Special Thanks

** Additional Possible Features

 Org-mode also allows for a shortcut such as alt+→ to move headings quickly from h1 to h2 and so on. and alt+ ← to move from h2 to h1

 This is something I’d like to turn into a request or if possible even develop as a plug in (perhaps as I get more advanced with JavaScript, it might be possible)
