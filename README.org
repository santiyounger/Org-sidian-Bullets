** This Is What It Looks Like In Emacs
   
     This Screenshot is taken from the original github repo (it’s org-mode in emacs)

 Here’s the code to put in your obsidian.css file

 I haven’t yet tested in various themes, but it works okay so far!

** Things To Consider

 There are spaces that allow this kind of indentation (achieved through left margins in the code).
 
#+BEGIN_SRC html
 ◉
  ○
   ✸
     ◉
      ○
       ✸
#+END_SRC 

** Installation/Set-Up

   Set-up is very easy, open one of the links bellow to the code.
   copy and paste it at the end of your obsidian.css file.*

   Keep in mind that some obsidian theme's might not be compatible.

   If you want to test it, do it with my [[https://github.com/santiyounger/Reverie-Obsidian-Theme][Obsidian Theme Reverie]].

***  Colored Bullet Points Version

** Additional Possible Features

 Org-mode also allows for a shortcut such as alt+→ to move headings quickly from h1 to h2 and so on. and alt+ ← to move from h2 to h1

 This is something I’d like to turn into a request or if possible even develop as a plug in (perhaps as I get more advanced with javascript, it might be possible)

**  Considerations

 This looks a lot better when all headings are the same size
