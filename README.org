this css code to replace the hashtag symbol # used for headers and change it for UTF-8 symbols.

H1 instead of # display ◉

I come from using spacemacs and I love org-mode. I moved most of my workflow to obsidian, but there’s one thing I really miss, which is org-bullet points (this adds cools symbols to headings)

** This is what it looks like in emacs:

 Here’s the code to put in your obsidian.css file

 I havn’t yet tested in various themes, but it works okay so far!

** Things to consider

 There are spaces that allow this kind of indentation (achieved through spaces)
 
#+BEGIN_SRC css
 ◉
  ○
   ✸
     ◉
      ○
       ✸
#+END_SRC 

** Additional possible features

 Org-mode also allows for a shortcut such as alt+→ to move headings quickly from h1 to h2 and so on. and alt+ ← to move from h2 to h1

 This is something I’d like to turn into a request or if possible even develop as a plug in (perhaps as I get more advanced with javascript, it might be possible)

**  Considerations

 This looks a lot better when all headings are the same size
